# BSPokerProject
Rules: BS poker is a card game with rules as follows. A set number of cards is dealt to each player. The players go around a circle calling out higher and higher poker hands, trying to guess which poker hands can be adequately formed using the cards pooled together by all the players. Then when one player calls BS, all cards are revealed. If the last claim was true, the player who called BS loses. If it was false, the player who was convicted of BS loses.

Special BS poker rules: 2's are wild cards which can represent any suit and any number/royal. Poker hands longer than 5 cards are possible.
