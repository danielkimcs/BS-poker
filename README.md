# BSPokerProject
BS Poker is a turn-based multiplayer card game involving a standard 52 card deck. We will use Python Tkinter to code a user interface for players to take turns playing BS Poker on a single device. The UI will incorporate graphics and text labels to present the state of the game to the user, while backend development will involve various custom classes to deal with various mechanics and rules of BS Poker, which will strongly reflect principles of OOP.

Rules: A set number of cards is dealt to each player. The players go around a circle calling out higher and higher poker hands, trying to guess which poker hands can be adequately formed using the cards pooled together by all the players (with a twist: 2's are wild cards, meaning that they can become any rank and suit that has not appeared in the pool). Then when one player calls BS, all cards are revealed. If the last claim was true, the player who called BS gets a strike. If it was false, the player who was convicted of BS gets a strike. Then a new round begins: cards are collected, reshuffled, and dealt again, but the player who got a strike starts with one additional card in his or her hand. If a player accrues a set number of strikes, he or she is out of the game. Rounds are played over and over again until everyone is out except for one person, who would be the winner.
